# roBob the builder
Bob the builder's slightly challenged, less fleshy cousin.

### Main idea
Structure building (inspired by Minecraft!)

### Description
For object building, we will try to get a simulated robot to build a structure out of blocks based on one or more images of the structure that is shown at the beginning. Blocks of varying size and weight are placed around the environment, and the robot would need to determine how to move those blocks around in order to create the structure.

### Challenges
|Planning|Actuation|Sensing|
|-|-|-|
|Plans the path and order of blocks to place|Locomotion in space|Senses the environment to move around and move blocks|
|Plans how to explore the space and find blocks to place|Picking up, putting down, and transporting blocks|Views the initial picture to determine what to build|
